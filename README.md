# LeadsTrackerExtension
Learning JS

Creating a chrome extension that stores any links you need on the browser. Don't need to save it to a text file, just keep it in the extension.


To try out the extension:
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Turn on developer mode on the top right
- Click "Load unpacked" and add the project folder along with the "manifest.json"
